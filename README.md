## Description

This project is meant to give myself a little more information about coding prior to the bootcamp. I would like to be able to write code and create websites, so these lessons were very beneficial. I had no prior knowledge of coding before this project, so it has helped a lot so far. I have learned that it will take a lot of practice and discipline to make it through this course.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
